Repository Management - Setup & Installation - Hosted Repository:-
============================================================================

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

	- Understand the general purpose and capabilities of a repository group.
	- Recognize the need for a repository group. 
	- Demonstrate how to create a repository group via the Maven group recipe. 
	- Demonstrate how to download components from the Central Repository through the repository group. 
	- Demonstrate how to navigate and manage the contents of a repository group.
	
	
A repository group is:
	- Its own access point, separate from proxy and hosted repositories.
	- Created by adding repositories as members of a ordered list.
	- A combined repository of locally published and remotely cached components.
	- A unique endpoint that users can access without having to retrieve components from hosted and proxy repositories.
	
	
A repository group is a one-stop location where developers can collaborate on a project with all available components assigned to it. 
If you’re an administrator, you can dynamically add repositories without updating developer settings. If you’re a developer, 
you can access the contents of the group by sending requests directly to the repository manager.


The request passes through a list of combined repositories, looking for a component. The first match in the group ordering is what will be returned 
to a developer’s local environment. These requests can be done by running a software build from your terminal.


Repository groups become necessary if your organization has multiple teams working on multiple projects. If you’re an administrator you’ll find it 
less cumbersome to order your proxy and hosted repositories into a group designed for a development team.


****It’s important to note that a group doesn’t store components. You can’t publish or deploy components directly to this repository type. Groups just aggregate 
content from other repositories. If you want to modify components in a group repository, publish those changes to a hosted repository included in the group.****


Understanding Maven Group Repositories:-
-----------------------------------------
	- When you install Nexus Repository, look for one specific built-in repository called "maven-public". If you recall in Repository Manager Basics, 
	  this pre-configured group consists of:
		- The remote proxy for the Central Repository
		- Maven-snapshots, a repository for you to host multiple versions of a project in development
		- Maven-releases, a repository for you to host a stable project set for production
