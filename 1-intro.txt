Functions of a Repository Manager:- 
-------------------------------------

Let’s think of a repository manager like you would think of a warehouse for parts. A warehouse serves as a centralized location for storage of parts and manages 
receiving, sending, and everything in between. Even with Lean business models, there is a need to manage and store parts using a system that is optimized for that purpose. 

 - The warehouse for software parts is called a repository manager. Repository managers play an essential role in any enterprise, or open-source, software development 
   effort allowing you to manage all parts involved in the development process and avoid inefficient practices.
   
Implementing a repository manager allows you to:
	- Enable greater collaboration between developers.
	- Bring increased build performance due to a wider distribution of software and locally available parts.
	- Reduce network bandwidth and dependency on remote repositories.
	- Insulate your company from outages in the internet, outages of public repositories (Maven Central, npm, etc.), or even removal of an open source component.
